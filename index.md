## About
I am karim bahri [Holberton school](https://www.holbertonschool.com/tn/fr) student.
I started this project for the reason that i like create my own tools which serves to automate some repetitive tasks.
I used python for this project specifically tkinter module because it is more flexible than other low level language.
Also python has a vast community worldwide and this can be very useful when you hit a bug.
